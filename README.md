## Laravel 5.1 SweetAlert

Special thanks to https://github.com/socieboy/alerts for this package but changed a few things and wanted to learn myself how to make this sort of package also, so Kudos to Socieboy :)

##Installation

Add to your composer.json file the package.

````
"infinety/sweetalert": "^0.1.0"
````

Update your dependencies

````
composer update
````

After install this package you have to set the service provider on your config/app.php file

````
Infinety\SweetAlert\AlertServiceProvider::class
````


Copy the required assets of SweetAlert to your public folder. Those assets would be place in the css and js respective directory.

````
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=alerts
````

Then in your master view add those styles and scripts. Put this style between the <head> </head> tags

````
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/sweetalert.css">
````

Add the JS script before close your </body> tag.

````
<script src="js/sweetalert.js"></script>
````

Include the alerts view to your master view. Add this code right after set the JS script file.

````
@include('Alerts::alerts')
````

###Usage

On your controllers is a perfect place to use it, any way you can fire the alerts from jobs or events.

````
alert('Title', 'Message')


alert()->error('Title', 'Message')


alert()->success('Title', 'Message')


alert()->overlay('Title', 'Message')
````
